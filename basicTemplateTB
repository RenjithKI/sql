/*
The solutions in the video are problematic on a number of counts. Solutions for 1, 3 and 6 as provided can all return more results 
than intended, which can cause problems down the line. I would keep looking for an employee who had a better understanding of 
what they were doing. That 'where-in-select-max' pattern produces answers that are mostly correct, most of the time, 
but is ultimately wrong.

I must admit that I only run across SQL from time to time, and I've not used 'between', and 'group by' is not something that 
sprang readily to mind. I provided 6 only after considering the video's solution, but include it as I feel it offers something of 
value (considering the lackluster solution in the video).
